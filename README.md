This website show what I have learned in coding this past semester. I created a one page scroll website with refrence to w3schools. I created a background header that should fill the desktop screen but I did still have trouble with it. I also created a gallery featuring my recent work by using a container and div class and seperating them by column.

Although I did not perfer code, I did learn alot by creating this website, it was quite frustrating but I am pround of the final product. I organized sections by headers and seperated them with divs.
